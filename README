Foundry Utilities
-----------------

This package is a set of utility functions which we find useful at
WML.

The class is called wml::FoundryUtilities (it may in future be renamed to
wml::futil in a refactoring exercise).

wml::FoundryUtilities contains a set of public static functions to
make our programming life easier.

The name comes from "Foundry Linux" which is the name we give to the
LFS-based from-source GNU/Linux OS which we distribute to our
customers.
