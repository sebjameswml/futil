Foundry Utilities
-----------------

This package, WML futil, is a set of utility functions which we find
useful at William Matthew Ltd (WML).

The main class is called wml::FoundryUtilities (it may in future be
renamed to wml::futil in a refactoring exercise).

wml::FoundryUtilities contains a set of public static functions to
make our programming life easier.

Two additional classes are provided - wml::Process which is used to
launch and interact with forked processes, and wml::FileTyper which is
a C++ wrapper around libmagic.

futil depends on libuuid and libmagic, both of which are available
under open source licences.

The name comes from "Foundry Linux" which is the name we give to the
LFS-based from-source GNU/Linux OS which we distribute to our
customers.
